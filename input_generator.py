# One line for each location - entry  j in line i marks the distance of edge from node i to j. 'x' if no edge.
# index i,i should also be 'x', no edge from a node to itself. # Distances max value 2bil, max 5 decimals.
# Graph must be connected - any line needs an entry to represent an edge from every node.
# Enforce triangle inequality
