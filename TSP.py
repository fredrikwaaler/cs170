# What needs to be made?

# 1. You need a proper TSP approx
# 2. You need dijkstras to calculate way between the nodes
# 3. You need a function which takes a graph and a set of cluster (centers) + locations
# The function should find the shortest distances between all those clusters
# Then the function should return a new graph containing only those clusters and the shortest paths
# between them. Then you can give this to TSP to calculate the best route between the clusters.
